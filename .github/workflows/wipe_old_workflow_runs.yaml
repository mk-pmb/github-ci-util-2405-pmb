      #=======================================================================
      # The part after `@` specifies the branch to use.
      # I need `experimental` here in order to conveniently test that branch.
      # However, in all other repos you should probably use "v1" instead:
      # - uses: mk-pmb/github-ci-util-2405-pmb/act/purge-old-workflow-runs@v1
      - uses: mk-pmb/github-ci-util-2405-pmb/act/purge-old-workflow-runs@experimental

          api_token: '${{ github.token }}'
